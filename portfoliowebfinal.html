			<h1>CompSci Final</h1>
			<p>For my CompSci Final I worked with a partner and we created a trivia game/race. 
			Players must answer questions racing against another person. The first person to finish wins. Here are some
			screen shots of the game and the code for it below!
			</p>
			<br><iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="500px" src="https://repl.it/H95S/1?lite=true"></iframe>
</br>
			<br><p>Here's the code for the game. We had to make two other files besides the main one to make it easier 
			on ourselves. We created a text file which another file reads from. That way it is easier to edit our questions
			and answers as well as add information. The second file we created was a reading file which interpreted the 
			text file. This deciphers which line is an answer or a question and puts them into categorized lists. The main
			file takes the lists and chooses random items from the list(the questions) by using the random.randint function.
			We programed the game to loop on the same question until the user answers correctly.</br>
